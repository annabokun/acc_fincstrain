    # Incorporate caregiver intensity and/or health/functional status of the aging parent     

    # Control for HH size

    # Control for employment 
      # working for pay provides economic and social resources and respite from caregiving, 
      # but on the other it can also create stress and overload when combined with caregiving

    # Interaction effects 
      # Caregiving intensity x coresidence 
      # to test for significant differences according to coresidence for those providing high-intensity care (i.e., daily/almost daily)

    # Stratify descriptives + models by marital status / gender 

    # Replicate the living arrangements patterns of the HEPESE using the ACS

    # Incorporate measures of family asset transfers 
      # Has the aging parent transferred the home to the ACC? 
      # How is this associated with ACC financial strain?
      # Create an indicator for this (1 = if a parent reports owning a home in wave 7 but does not own it in wave 9 AND the ACC's headship status changes from son/daughter in wave 7 to HH head in wave 9, 
        # although there are notable misclassification issues (e.g., parent sold house, etc.). 

    # Add "sandwich status" variable 

    # Sensitivity analysis
      # Add state dummies to examine whether state differences in unobserved factors, such as gender norms, policy, and welfare state arrangements, are driving results

    # Explore missingness (INCOME, Medicare & marital stat)
      # Impute missing income

    # Link waves 7 + 9
