## Notes for linking 

    ## Pain in the ass, because many vars reflect similar things, but have different names! 
    # e.g., CAREGIVER'S EDUCATION 
      # W9: EDUC9I: Informant Years of education
      # W7: CEDUC7I_1: Education of respondent`s child #1 (per informant)

        # Solution? 

          # Only keep data from child #1 in W

          # Rename CEDUC7I_1 to EDUC7I_1
