								<div><strong>Alternate Title:</strong> <p>HEPESE Wave 7, HEPESE Wave 7 Informant Interviews</p></div>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> <p>The Hispanic EPESE provides data on risk factors for mortality and morbidity in Mexican Americans in order to contrast how these factors operate differently in non-Hispanic White Americans, African Americans, and other major ethnic groups.</p>
<p>The Wave 7 dataset comprises the sixth follow-up of the baseline Hispanic EPESE (HISPANIC ESTABLISHED POPULATIONS FOR THE EPIDEMIOLOGIC STUDIES OF THE ELDERLY, 1993-1994: [ARIZONA, CALIFORNIA, COLORADO, NEW MEXICO, AND TEXAS] [ICPSR 2851]). The baseline Hispanic EPESE collected data on a representative sample of community-dwelling Mexican Americans, aged 65 years and older, residing in the five southwestern states of Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas.</p>
<p>The public-use data cover demographic characteristics (age, sex, type of Hispanic race, income, education, marital status, number of children, employment, and religion), height, weight, social and physical functioning, chronic conditions, related health problems, health habits, self-reported use of dental, hospital, and nursing home services, and depression. Subsequent follow-ups provide a cross-sectional examination of the predictors of mortality, changes in health outcomes, and institutionalization, and other changes in living arrangements, as well as changes in life situations and quality of life issues. </p>
<p>During this 7th Wave (dataset 1), 2010-2011, re-interviews were conducted either in person or by proxy, with 659 of the original respondents. This Wave also includes 419 re-interviews from the additional sample of Mexican Americans aged 75 years and over with higher average-levels of education than those of the surviving cohort who were added in Wave 5, increasing the total number of respondents to 1,078.</p>
<p>
The Wave 7 Informant Interviews dataset (dataset 2) includes data which corresponds to the sixth follow-up of the baseline Hispanic EPESE Wave 7 and included re-interviews with 1,078 Mexican Americans aged 80 years and older. During these interviews, participants were asked to provide the name and contact information of the person they are "closer to" or they "depend on the most for help." These INFORMANTS were contacted and interviewed regarding the health, function, social situation, finances, and general well-being of the ongoing Hispanic EPESE respondents. Information was also collected on the informant's health, function, and caregiver responsibilities and burden. This dataset includes information from 925 informants, more than two-thirds of whom were children of the respective respondents.</p></span></p>

								<div><strong>Date of Collection:</strong> <p>2010-02-09 -- 2011-09-12</p></div>
								<div><strong>Data Collection Notes:</strong> <p>Data from the informant interviews are linkable to the respondent data in the Hispanic EPESE waves via a unique ID variable (Q_NO) shared by each respondent-informant pair., The Resource Book, vital status, and other supporting material for the Hispanic Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly may be obtained from earlier Hispanic EPESE collections (i.e., ICPSR 2851, 3385, 4102, 4314).</p></div>
		        		<h2>Methodology:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Study Purpose:</strong> The primary purpose of the series was to provide estimates of the prevalence of key physical health conditions, mental health conditions, and functional impairments in older Mexican Americans and to compare these estimates with those for other populations.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Study Design:</strong> <p>Hispanic EPESE, 1993-1994 (ICPSR 2851), was modeled after the design of:</p>
<p>ESTABLISHED POPULATIONS FOR EPIDEMIOLOGIC STUDIES OF THE ELDERLY, 1981-1993: [EAST BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS, IOWA AND WASHINGTON COUNTIES, IOWA, NEW HAVEN, CONNECTICUT, AND NORTH CENTRAL NORTH CAROLINA] (ICPSR 9915) and</p> <p>ESTABLISHED POPULATIONS FOR EPIDEMIOLOGIC STUDIES OF THE ELDERLY, 1996-1997: PIEDMONT HEALTH SURVEY OF THE ELDERLY, FOURTH IN-PERSON SURVEY [DURHAM, WARREN, VANCE, GRANVILLE, AND FRANKLIN COUNTIES, NORTH CAROLINA] (ICPSR 2744).</p></span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Sample:</strong> <p>This study utilizes a complex, multistage sample design. The first follow-up of the baseline data (Hispanic EPESE Wave II, 1995-1996 [ICPSR 3385]) followed 2,438 of the original 3,050 respondents, and the second follow-up (Hispanic EPESE Wave III, 1998-1999 [ICPSR 4102]) followed 1,980 of these respondents. The third follow-up (Hispanic EPESE Wave IV [ICPSR 4314]) followed 1,682 of the original respondents. The fourth follow-up (Hispanic EPESE Wave V [ICPSR 25041]) followed 1,167 of the original respondents. The fifth follow-up (Hispanic EPESE Wave VI [ICPSR 29654]) followed 921 of the original respondents. This sixth follow-up (Hispanic EPESE Wave VII) includes 659 of the original respondents.</p>
<p>The Informant dataset reflects family members and/or caregivers personally identified by participants from a longitudinal study that used a complex, multistage sample design.</p>
